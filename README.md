# Spinsim 0.98

This version of Spinsim supports most of the opcodes in the P2 v32b instruction
set.  The opcodes that are not supported are as follows:

    xzero   xinit   xcont   hubset  setdacs setxfrq getxacc getbrk
    cogbrk  brk     setcy   setci   setcq   setcfrq setcmod getrnd
    xoro32  skip    skipf   execf 

`skip`, `skipf` and `execf` have been partially implemented, but do not handle jumps
or interrupts correctly.

`spinsim`/`spinsim.exe` runs in the P1 mode by default.  It can be set to run in the P2 mode
with the `-t` parameter.  In the P2 mode, `spinsim` will load a P2 binary file into
hub RAM, and start cog 0 with the code located at $000.  A simulated serial
port is supported by using the `-b` option.  The default baud rate is 115200, but
other rates can be used by specifying it with `-b`, such as `-b9600`.  The serial
port uses pins 63 and 62 when in the P2 mode.

`spinsim` is built under Linux, MinGW or Cygwin by using the `Makefile`, and typing
`make`.  The Windows executable, `spinsim.exe` is included with this distribution.

The sub-directory `verify` contains five programs that have been used to test
`spinsim` against the FPGA implementation.  Approximately 150 instructions have
been verified to match the hardware.  The `verify` directory contains the
original C source code and the output from running the test programs on the
FPGA.

A test program can be run by going into the `verify` directory and typing

    ../spinsim -t -b testopsa.bin

The output can be redirected to a file and compared with the hardware file
to verify that `spinsim` matches the hardware.

Spinsim supports the cordic instructions, but implements them with C functions
instead of simulating the cordic hardware.  The instructions `xvector` and
`xrotate` are functionally equivalent to the P2, but will produce slightly
different results.  `qdiv` and `qfract` bit exact results as long as the quotient
fits within 32 bits.  It produces different results if the quotient overflows
a 32-bit value.  The I/O streamer is currently not supported.

Spinsim contains a simple debugger, which is enabled with the `-d` command-line
option.  The debugger prints the prompt `DEBUG>` to indicate that it is ready
to accept a command.  The `help` command will print the following:

    Debug Commands
    help           - Print command list
    exit           - Exit spinsim
    step           - Run one cycle
    stepx          - Run next executed instruction
    run            - Run continuously
    verbose #      - Set verbosity level
    reboot         - Reboot the Prop
    setbr cog addr - Set breakpoint for cog to addr
    state cog      - Dump cog state
    peekc cog addr - Print out a cog memory location
    peekh addr     - Print out a hub memory location

The `step` command will run one cycle, and the `stepx` command will run any
non-executing cycles until it encounters an instruction that is executed.
The previous command can be executed again by just pushing the enter key.
This is useful for stepping where the `step` command is typed once, and
the enter key can then be used to `step` again.

The `run` command will run until a breakpoint is encountered or `^]` is typed.
`^]` is typed by holding down the `control` key and pressing the `]` key.
While running, `spinsim` will print out the results of each cycle as
controlled by the verbosity level, which is set by the `verbose` command.
The verbosity level can also be set with the command-line parameter `-v#`.

The verbosity levels are as follows:

    0 - Disable printing
    1 - Print only the executed instructions
    2 - Print only the executed instructions, and show the execution results
    3 - Print executed and instruction not executed due to condition code
    4 - Also print instructions invalidated in the pipeline due to jumps
    5 - Also print instructions that include hub and hardware waits
    6 - Also print instructions that include icache waits
    7 - Also print instructions waiting for a pin state
    8 - Print all cycles, including waitcnt waits

The verbosity level is entered as a hexadecimal number.  If the verbosity level
is entered as a single digit it will apply to all cogs.  If more than one digit
is entered each digit will be used for each cog, starting with cog 0 for the
right-most digit.  As an example, a value of `456` will cause `6` to be used for
cog 0, `5` for cog 1, and `4` for cog 2.  All other cogs will use `0`.
