Spinsim 0.75

This version of spinsim supports about two-thirds of the opcodes in the P2
instruction set.  The list of implemented opcodes is shown below, along with
the list of opcodes that have not been implemented yet.  Spinsim runs in the P1
mode by default.  It can be set to run in the P2 mode with the -t parameter.

In the P2 mode, spinsim will load a P2 OBJ file into hub RAM, and start cog 0
with the code located at $E00.  A simulated serial port is supported by using
the -b option.  The default baud rate is 115,200, but other rates can be used
by specifying it with -b, such as -b9600.  The serial port uses pin 31 and 30,
just like with P1.

Spinsim is built using the Makefile, and typing make.  I have successfully
built and run it under Cygwin and Ubuntu Linux.

The sample program, pfth.spin can be run by building it with the PNut P2
assembler.  PNut is contained in the Terasic_Prop2_Emulation zip file,
which can be downloaded from the first post in the "HUB EXEC Update Here"
thread in the Propeller 2 forum.

There are two demo programs, which are the pfth Forth interpreter and the
p1spin Spin interpreter that runs P1 Spin binaries on the P2 processor.
The pfth program is run under spinsim as follows:

    ./spinsim -t -b pfth.obj

p1spin runs at a baud rate of 57600, so it is run as follows:

    ./spinsim -t -b57600 p1spin.obj

Spinsim supports execution from cog memory and hub execution, but it does not
support multi-tasking.  Only the core processor is supported, and none of the
counters, video hardware or cordic hardware is simulated.  Support for multi-
tasking, peripheral hardware and cordic instructions will be added later.

Spinsim contains a simple debugger, which is enabled with the -d command-line
option.  The debugger prints the prompt "DEBUG>" to indicate that it is ready
to accept a command.  The "help" command will print the following:

    Debug Commands
    help           - Print command list
    exit           - Exit spinsim
    step           - Run one cycle
    stepx          - Run next executed instruction
    run            - Run continuously
    verbose #      - Set verbosity level
    reboot         - Reboot the Prop
    setbr cog addr - Set breakpoint for cog to addr
    state cog      - Dump cog state

The "step" command will run one cycle, and the "stepx" command will run any
non-executing cycles until it encounters an instruction that is executed.
The previous command can be executed again by just pushing the enter key.
This is useful for stepping where the "step" command is typed once, and
the enter key can then be used to step again.

The "run" command will run until a breakpoint is encountered or ^] is typed.
^] is typed by holding down the control key and pressing the "]" key.
While running, spinsim will print out the results of each cycle as
controlled by the verbosity level, which is set by the "verbose" command.
The verbosity level can also be set with the command-line parameter "-v#".

The verbosity levels are as follows:

    0 - Disable printing
    1 - Print only the executed instructions
    2 - Print only the executed instructions, and show the execution results
    3 - Print executed and instruction not executed due to condition code
    4 - Also print instructions invalidated in the pipeline due to jumps
    5 - Also print instructions that include hub and hardware waits
    6 - Also print instructions that include icache waits
    7 - Also print instructions waiting for a pin state
    8 - Print all cycles, including waitcnt waits

The verbosity level is entered as a hexadecimal number.  If the verbosity level
is entered as a single digit it will apply to all cogs.  If more than one digit
is entered each digit will be used for each cog, starting with cog 0 for the
right-most digit.  As an example, a value of 456 will cause 6 to be used for
cog 0, 5 for cog 1, and 4 for cog 2.  All other cogs will use 0.
